- Words().anagram("moonstarer").match("..t.o.....") -> "astronomer"

- Do we need to create the Words object?
  - Could the first method be static?

- Words.anagram("moonstarer").match("..t.o.....") -> "astronomer"

- The static form looks nicer
  - Not sure how it would work though

- Each method returns a Words object with the currently filtered
  collection of Words
