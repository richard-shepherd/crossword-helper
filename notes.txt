Problems / improvements
-----------------------

- There are too many two-letter words which are not real words 
  - We should filter these out
  - Same for one-letter words

- Is there a list of words used in crosswords which could be used as a filter?

- Multi-word anagrams should be shown split by word (or underscore) to make them more readable
