Problems / improvements
-----------------------

- There are too many two-letter words which are not real words 
  - We should filter these out
  - Same for one-letter words

- Is there a list of words used in crosswords which could be used as a filter?

- Multi-word anagrams should be shown split by word (or underscore) to make them more readable

- Need a database (file?) of "crossword" definitions
  - One = i
  - Ambassador = HE (his excellency)
  - Self righteous = PI
  - Son = S
  - Artillery = RA (Royal Artillery)
  - Nothing = O
  - Second = S
  - Partners = NS (from bridge) (Can we have EW as well?)
  - Island = MAN (!)
  - Writer = PEN (thing which writes)
  - Phonetic alphabet, eg Yankee = Y, India = I etc
  - Desire = YEN
  - Arrived = IN
  - Laugh = HA
  - More = OVER

- contains(letters)
  - Word must contain letters
  - Even though we're not sure where
  - Maybe done with set intersection (though doesn't quite work for doubled letters)

- Need to be better at charade clues
