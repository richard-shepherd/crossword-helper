Problems / improvements
-----------------------

- There are too many two-letter words which are not real words 
  - We should filter these out
  - Same for one-letter words

- Is there a list of words used in crosswords which could be used as a filter?

- Multi-word anagrams should be shown split by word (or underscore) to make them more readable

- Need a database (file?) of "crossword" definitions
  - One = i
  - Ambassador = HE (his excellency)
  - Self righteous = PI
  - Son = S
  - Artillery = RA (Royal Artillery)
  - Nothing = O
  - Second = S
  - Partners = NS (from bridge) (Can we have EW as well?)
  - Island = MAN (!)
  - Writer = PEN (thing which writes)
  - Phonetic alphabet, eg Yankee = Y, India = I etc
  - Desire = YEN
  - Arrived = IN
  - Laugh = HA
  - More = OVER

  - Run = GO
  - Officer = COL
  - Not wrong = LEGAL
  - Yarn = HANK
  - Strike = RAM
  - Hear  = TRY
  - Computer = PC, MAC
  - Applaud = CLAP
  - Role = PART
  - Householder = SNAIL
  - Island = RUM
  - Rum = island
  - Old = O
  - Party = bash

- contains(letters)
  - Word must contain letters
  - Even though we're not sure where
  - Maybe done with set intersection (though doesn't quite work for doubled letters)

- Need to be better at charade clues


Bits and Pieces
---------------
- How do we parse for bits-and-pieces (bp)?

- There are two things we want to do which seem to contradict each other:

- A) We want to look for any occurence of a bp word / phrase, even if it
  is part of a longer word.
  - For example: sailor = tar
  - We want to return this even if the word in the clue is "sailors"
  - So we search for "sailor" in clue

- B) But: some bp words / phrases are very short
  - eg, "a", "us", "te" etc
  - Or even sub-words in longer words, eg "right" in "righteous"
  - If these are not whole words, we do not want to report them

- How do we square the circle of A) and B)?

- Maybe on the length of the word?
  - If it is <= 3 letters, then it has to be a whole word?
